#### tidesapp

tidesapp is an application that gathers high tide data for a number of locations and reports the results to the user. This is a new app I started on 8/23/2022. My intention is that it will grow over the next days or weeks to encompass some additional features. These are some of the skills this app highlights..

- Test design and implementation
- Python
- pytest
- Selenium
- XPATH (Finding and interracting with DOM elements using XPATH)
- JSON parsing
- Command line parsing with *argparse*
- Regular expressions (advanced)

#### int2str

int2str is a small app which translates integers into their spoken-word equivalent (e.g., input: 55, output: 'fifty five'). This app highlights the following skills...

- Clean and modular code design
- Test design and implementation
- Python
- pytest
- Enum classes
- Parametrized pytest test methods
- Expected failure handling
- General adherance to PEP8 and PEP257 recommendations, without being hobgobbled by them.
